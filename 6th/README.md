learn to package program with webpack. configuring webpack is troublesome.<br>
and i didn't know the create-react-app i used to build react program until now, it can also package program because it has webpack built in. it just need to enter 'run build' to finish package work.<br>
----------------------------------2nd commit--------------------------------------------<br>
update webpack-dev-server and webpack hmr. create-react-app is auto configure it. and i think configure it by myself is also necessary.<br>
