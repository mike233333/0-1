try to finish task form ife2015, a code project.the first task ask to code beautiful page, not easy as i think.<br>
it is difficult to deal with layout.css is a huge challenge form me.<br>
----------------------------second commit-------------------------------------<br>
task2 is a program about javascript,i have spent the most time in studying js, so some task are easy for me.Well there are also some task i haven't coding in the past.<br>
------------------------------3rd commit-------------------------------------------<br>
task3 is not easy as the guide of ife said,may i thankful that i have coded the 'to do list' in the past? lol<br>
but the task3 is a larger program of 'to do list' than i have code before.at last it's more than 600 lines of codes.it must have lots of part can optimization, because it is a mass when i review.i almost can't help to delete it and recode again.<br>
-----------------------------4th commit-----------------------------------------<br>
recode task3.<br>
code after refered others' pattern on the net.create a new object and add new prototype method to it.And add data as an arrtibute in it.<br>
it surely solve the problem about the messy localstorage data.And i feel easy to review the code.Is it probably the difference between Object-oriented and Process-oriented?<br>
-------------------------------5th commit----------------------------------------<br>
task4 need to code the mobile version of task3 and use some tools like grunt and gulp to pack the code.<br>
and it is the first time to use node.js,amazing! javascript can be used in back-end now.i think it will be an important thing in my learning list.<br>
------------------------------6th commit-----------------------------------------<br>
learn and use React and Redux to rebuild the todolist.framework is a new thing for me,watch the book about react like study a new programming language.<br>
and at last the sum of code lines seems more than the lines coding with native js langunage.it is funny.<br>
i think the advantage of coding with framwork is probably about the modularization? perhaps its will show it effect when the whole project being larger.<br>
-------------------------------7th commit----------------------------------------<br>
start coding the ife2016. after finish the ife2015, lots of tasks in ife2016 seem easily for me. while there are also some interesting tasks like binary tree, multi-branch and some path finding algorithm.<br>
i found the algorithm is a very powerful tool in coding, maybe should go to do some algorithm subjects to promote myself.<br> 
-------------------------------8th commit----------------------------------------<br>
finish task50, and trying to use typescript in it's reconfiguration with react.i think it will spend lots of time.<br>
-------------------------------9th commit----------------------------------------<br>
finally finish the ife, when using typescript in program, there are lots of type specifications and requirements which i never know in javascript.<br>
microsoft and many employees realize the strict type testing can reduce bugs effectively, i think so too. but after rewriting the program with typescript. i found that if the program is so simple with just less than a thousand lines of code, use typesceipt maybe cost many times in coding type or interface. perhaps i can control my code quality without typescript. of course in a huge project it can maximize its effect.<br>
and i also think that coding a simple program using react maybe spent more time than using javascript and jQuery. especially code about the event binding, getting html tag and parameter deliver.<br>
maybe my thought are all wrong, hope i won't be embarrsed when l see this passage in the future.<br>
--------------------------------probably is conclusion--------------------------------<br>
recalling about the time spent here, it is such a long journey for me.<br>
these months are probably the first time i try actively to study something i want. it is the first step for my new life. wish i can have a nice year.<br>
<br>

----------------------------------surprise!----------------------------------------------<br>
learn to package program with webpack. configuring webpack is troublesome.<br>
and i didn't know the create-react-app i used to build react program until now, it can also package program because it has webpack built in. it just need to enter 'run build' to finish package work.<br>
